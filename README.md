# Light Sensor for Test Jig

This PCB defines a light sensor.  It can be used to determine whether an LED functions or not.  It was originally designed for use with the Chibitronics Love-to-Code project, and was adapted for the Fomu project.

It should be as thin as possible.  It was fabbed out on a 0.1mm flat-flex design.  It can be designed as either 1- or 2-layers, as necessary.
